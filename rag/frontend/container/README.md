# Frontend Container

This directory contains the source code and Dockerfile for the RAG frontend Flask web server.

A prebuilt image is published and used by default, so you do not need to build anything to deploy
the guide. Follow the steps below only if you want to run your own build of the frontend — for
example after changing the application code.

## Prerequisites

- An Artifact Registry Docker repository in your GCP project.
- Authenticated Docker client (`gcloud auth configure-docker <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev`).

## Option A — Local Docker build

```bash
cd rag/frontend/container
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t rag-frontend:latest .
```

To push to Artifact Registry for GKE deployment:

```bash
docker tag rag-frontend:latest <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO>/rag-frontend:latest
docker push <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO>/rag-frontend:latest
```

## Option B — Cloud Build

Builds and pushes to Artifact Registry in one step:

```bash
cd rag/frontend/container
gcloud builds submit \
  --tag <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO>/rag-frontend:latest .
```

## Set the image reference

After pushing, uncomment `frontend_image` in `workloads.tfvars` and point it at your image. Pin by
digest rather than a tag, so the deployed image cannot change underneath you:

```hcl
frontend_image = "<REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO>/rag-frontend@sha256:<DIGEST>"
```

To get the digest after pushing:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' \
  <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO>/rag-frontend:latest
```

## Notes

- **Embedding model cache.** The container runs with a read-only root filesystem and writes the
  Hugging Face cache to `/tmp/hf-cache`, backed by an `emptyDir`. That cache does not survive a pod
  restart, and each replica downloads its own copy of the embedding model
  (`intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`, ~500Mi) on first request. This keeps the quick-start simple; for
  a longer-lived or larger-scale deployment, back the cache with a `PersistentVolumeClaim` or bake
  the model into the image instead.
- **Registry.** The commands above use Artifact Registry (`<REGION>-docker.pkg.dev`), which is what
  you should use for your own deployments. The CI pipeline in `cloudbuild.yaml` pushes to
  `gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/rag-frontend` instead — that is a throwaway image built per-run for testing
  only, and is not the recommended path for users.
